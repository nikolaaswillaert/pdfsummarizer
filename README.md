# pdfsummarizer
a tool that takes a pdf and you can interact with the pdf (using langchain and openAI api)

Start the streamlit by typing in "streamlit run app.py" when in the root directory. 
Upload a pdf and start asking questions about the topic / author or anything related to the contents of the document

You will need an openAI API key as well. Add this key to the "apikey.py" file
